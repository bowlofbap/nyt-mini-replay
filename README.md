# NYT Crossword Replay

A Chrome extension that records your New York Times crossword solving sessions and creates shareable replays for friends to watch your solving strategy.

## Overview

NYT Crossword Replay automatically captures every keystroke, cell selection, and solving pattern as you complete crosswords on nytimes.com. When you finish, it generates a shareable link that lets others watch your solve in real-time with accurate timing and visual feedback.

## Features

- **Complete Input Tracking**: Records letters typed, deletions, and corrections
- **Visual State Capture**: Tracks cell selections (yellow highlights) and word highlighting (blue highlights)
- **Precise Timing**: Captures exact timestamps for accurate replay speed
- **Automatic Detection**: Starts recording when you begin solving, stops when completed

### Replay Viewing
- **Real-time Playback**: Watch solves unfold with original timing
- **Speed Controls**: View at 1x, 2x, or 4x speed
- **Visual Accuracy**: Shows cell selections and word highlights as they occurred
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different crossword sizes automatically
- **Share Anywhere**: Replay links work for anyone, no extension required

### Technical Features
